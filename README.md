# Amazon Sales Analysis
The Analysis mainly highlights the ‘General Overview’ and the ‘Periodic Overview’, upon the Sales transactions handled by the popular e-commerce platform 'Amazon', between the years 2010 and 2017, based on 76 countries and 12 different products.
## Assumptions:
1. The monetary aspects within the Dataset (Total Cost, Total Revenue, etc.) are all represented based on the ‘Dollar ($)’ format.
2.  The ‘Order Process Gap (Days)’, i.e., the difference between the ‘Order Date’ & the ‘Shipment Date’, has an impact on the ‘Customer Purchase Behavior’, which would influence the ‘Number of Units Sold’. 
## Metrics:
1. Total Revenue : Revenue earned over a specific product
2. Total Cost : Cost incurred for a specific product
3. Total Profit : Net Profit earned over a specific product
4. Units Sold : Number of units sold (Product Basis)
5. Order Process Gap : Number of Days between ‘Order Date’ and ‘Shipment Date’

## Insights: 
Amongst variety of Sales having handled across ‘76 countries’ and the respective regions, it is observed that about 15739 units of Fruits in Sao Tome and Principe have marked the highest sales, in terms of ‘Units Sold’, and about 124 units of Vegetables in Kyrgyzstan being the lowest in such aspect. When Online and Offline orders were handled in an equal proportion (50 orders each), the ‘Offline’ orders reflected a maximum number of ‘H’ priority orders (17 orders) and in case of ‘Online’ orders, it is observed that, a maximum number of ‘L’ priority orders (15 orders) have been reflected. On an overall basis, Cosmetics have marked the major contribution with about $ 36,601,510, followed by Office Supplies ($ 30,585,380), Household ($ 29,889,712), and so on., from the ‘Revenue’ point of view. By analyzing the impact of ‘Units Sold’ through the factor ‘Order Process Gap’ (in Days), it is observed that, there is an instability within the ‘Sales’ pattern. The reason would be of the difference in the ‘Purchasing Behavior’ pattern or the ‘Product Preference’. In this aspect, it is evident that, up to 30 Days of Order Process Gap would be an acceptable one, which specifically denotes that, about 9925 units were sold in such a number of days gap, which stands at the highest amongst other cases.

## Insights:
Over the time period of overall sales across ‘7 years’ (2010 – 2017), the ‘Key Performing’ monetary aspects showcases a specific pattern of change. On a ‘Product-wise’ point of view, it is evident that, ‘Higher the Cost incurred, Higher the Profit earned.’ For instance, as a whole, the product ‘Office Supplies’ marks the highest Cost incurred ($ 10,918,643 (Offline) and $ 13,737,153 (Online)). The profit earned by the same product stands as one of the top contributions amongst others (13.43%). Similar pattern is being reflected by the products - ‘Cosmetics’ (Cost : $ 10,993,764 (Offline) and $ 11,051,697 (Online); Profit : 32.96%) and ‘Household’ (Cost : $ 22,335,390 (Offline); Profit : 16.78%), which stands as the top-most contributors towards the ‘Profit’ aspect. On the ‘Region-wise’ point of view, Sub-Saharan Africa marks the highest Profit with $ 12,183,211, while, North America marks the lowest Profit with $ 1,457,943. The testimony behind the ‘Success’ factor of the Sales lies within the ‘Positive’ correlation between the Total Cost incurred and the Total Revenue earned. Here, ‘Break-even point’ is not being observed in any of the cases, and that the Total Revenue exceeds the Total Cost, which marks ‘Profit’ in all of the cases.
